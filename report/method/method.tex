\section{Method}
\subsection{Methodology and approach}
\subsubsection{Alternatives}
List how we could get the memory
\subsubsection{Chosen approach}
When starting the project we needed to decide weather to use an physical device or an emulator
to conduct our experiment on.\\
To make the experiment as close to reality as possible it should have been done on a physical device, 
however, an emulator gives us a close match to reality and is easily replicable. Also, by using an emulator 
we avoid rooting out own phones and installing a custom kernel
\subsection{Emulator environment}
Refer to appendix for detailed installation instructions
\subsection{Tools}
What criteria we had for our tools
\subsubsection{Volatility}
What is volatility? How could it be used?
Support for many platforms: Windows, Linux, OS X
Processes, network connections
\subsubsection{PhotoRec}
What is Photorec? How does it differ from Volatility
