\subsection{Methodology and approach}
  \subsubsection{Alternatives}
  We found several alternatives for acquisition of memory from android devices.
  \begin{description}
    \item[dd on /dev/mem] \hfill \\
      This is a very simple method for acquiring memory. But /dev/mem can only be used directly when the kernel is 
      compiled with the STRICT\_DEVMEM flag off or with a kernel version pre 2.6. The first kernel version ever used on 
      android is version 2.6.25 \footnote{http://elinux.org/Android\_Kernel\_Versions}.
    \item[fmem] \hfill \\
      fmem is a LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) which creates /dev/fmem. /dev/fmem is similar to /dev/mem, but without the limitations.
    \item[LiME LKM] \hfill \\
      LiME (Linux Memory Extractor) LKM \footnote{https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME} provides a forensically sound method for acquiring memory from 
      memory \cite{heriyanto2013procedures}.
  \end{description}
  \subsubsection{Chosen approach}
  For acquisition of memory we have chosen to use the LiME LKM.
\subsection{Environment}
When starting the project we needed to decide weather to use an physical device or an emulator
to conduct our experiment on.\\
To make the experiment as close to reality as possible it should have been done on a physical device, 
however, an emulator gives us a close match to reality and is easily replicable. Also, by using an emulator 
we avoid rooting our own phones, thus we avoid voiding warranty. Also, we found a guide on the Volatility 
wiki \footnote{https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Android} for how to dump memory with 
an Android emulator. Therefore we chose to use an emulator.\\
The guide is not very detailed, and some deviation from the guide was done to be able conduct the experiment. 
A detailed guide on the setup can be found in the appendix \ref{setup}.\\

The emulator was set up on a computer running the latest Ubuntu (Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86\_64).\\
The emulator we set up is based on the Nexus 7 (2012) and The Linux Kernel 2.6.29. This was chosen because of 
convenience, since the guide we followed is using this and the 2.6 Kernel have very few restrictions.
