% This file (c) 2009-2011 Elsevier Ltd.  Modifications may be freely made,
% provided the edited file is saved under a different name

% This file contains modifications for Procedia Computer Science
% but may easily be adapted to other journals

% Changes since version 1.1
% - added "procedia" option compliant with ecrc.sty version 1.2a
%   (makes the layout approximately the same as the Word CRC template)
% - added example for generating copyright line in abstract

%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% Add the 'procedia' option to approximate to the Word template
%\documentclass[3p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{listings}


\usepackage{bigfoot}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.  Contact the journal editorial office if in any doubt
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Provide the copyright line to appear in the abstract
%% Usage:
%   \CopyrightLine[<text-before-year>]{<year>}{<restt-of-the-copyright-text>}
%   \CopyrightLine[Crown copyright]{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}
%   \CopyrightLine{2011}{Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}
\CopyrightLine{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

% \biboptions{}

% if you have landscape tables

%% Title, authors and addresses

%% use the tnoteref command within \title for footnotes;
%% use the tnotetext command for the associated footnote;
%% use the fnref command within \author or \address for footnotes;
%% use the fntext command for the associated footnote;
%% use the corref command within \author for corresponding author footnotes;
%% use the cortext command for the associated footnote;

\begin{abstract}
Smart phones today are getting ever more powerful, and capable of doing most of the tasks usually associated 
with computers. This have made them increasingly interesting in forensics investigations and information 
theft. In this paper we present the findings we have done when looking at the volatile memory of a virtual 
android device. In our research we have used string search, hex editor and other tools to search through the memory to 
find cleartext information to prove what sort of information that are stored here. %Prove? skal vi bevise noe? "See what information we could find elns"
We also discuss the 
possibility and usefulness of automated forensics tools to look through smart phone memory and the 
difficulties faced when developing such tools. Another aspect of our research was to look at secure applications 
to see whether or not the volatile memory is taken into account in development. This research provides a 
baseline for further development of memory analysis tools, proving its usefulness and what information  you 
can expect to find on the subject.
