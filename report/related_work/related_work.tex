In the last years there has been done a lot of research on acquisition of memory
and analysis techniques, targeting Linux and Android. The most common way to 
gain access to memory is gaining root privileges and load a new kernel into the 
phone. While this is not ideal, as itâ€™s overwriting some of the memory in the 
progress, it is the only known way to get access to memory of all running processes.\\

In 2011 J. Sylve et al. presented a paper that described a forensic sound 
approach of acquiring Android memory. \cite{acq_vol_android_mem} This paper looked 
into ways of obtaining memory, with different tools and different approaches. In 
their experiment, with an emulator, they performed a memory dumping method that 
is called \textit{pmemsave} and compared it to other ways of dumping memory. 
When compared to another method called Droid Memory Dumpstr (DMD) it was over 
99\% identical. Since the memory dumps takes time, in our experiment it took us 
5 minutes to dump 800mb of memory, some changes will naturally occur in the memory.\\

Based on these results, they believe that this method for dumping memory is a 
forensic sound process and can be used as evidence in court. To analysis the data 
extracted, different methods can be used, in this project they also used Volatility.
One of the key benefits of this open source program is the ability to make your 
own plugin. They made a plugin that separates the memory that belongs to a single 
process to make it much easier to manually analyse it. Unfortunately we were not 
able to find this plugin to test it.\\
% Hvem er they? Var det ikke disse pluginsa vi testa?

This may be the first paper published that presents a method of accurate memory acquisition on
Android, as they write in their conclusions "To our knowledge, this is the first published work on
accurate physical memory acquisition and deep memory analysis of the Android kernel's structures".
