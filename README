Project Title: 
Smartphone Memory Forensics

Project Type: 
Experiment where smartphone memory is target for digital forensic analysis

Problem description:
In computer forensics, memory/RAM have been common source of digital evidence. 
Modern smartphones also use memory for running OS, application and user data 
which might be of value in forensics investigations. Especially when encryption 
keys are required to decrypt critical digital evidence and when passwords for 
web and cloud services are needed to access more sources of evidence. How to 
preserve digital evidence when analysing smartphone memory/RAM?

Expected output:
One or more out of these:
    - A framework for, or overview of, forensics methods and techniques (based 
    on existing tools and methods) to conduct forensically sound analysis of 
    smartphone memory

    - A tool/toolkit for gathering digital evidence from smartphone memory

    - Proposed method for how to extract smartphone memory as evidence data in a
    forensically sound matter
